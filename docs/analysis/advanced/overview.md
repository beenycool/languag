# Advanced Language Analysis Overview

## Architecture

The advanced language analysis system consists of several key components:

1. **Analysis Pipeline** - Coordinates the flow of text through various engines
2. **Engines** - Specialized processors for different analysis types
3. **Context System** - Maintains document-level context for analysis
4. **Result Merger** - Combines results from multiple engines

```typescript
// Example pipeline initialization
import { PipelineCoordinator } from '../../src/main/analysis/pipeline/pipeline-coordinator';
const pipeline = new PipelineCoordinator();
```

## Component Relationships

1. Text enters through the **Pipeline Coordinator**
2. Passed to **Context Extractor** for document analysis
3. Distributed to specialized engines:
   - Context-aware grammar
   - Style analysis
   - Tone detection
4. Results merged and returned

## Integration Patterns

Integrate with the analysis system through:

1. **Direct API** - Call analysis methods directly
2. **IPC Channels** - Use the pre-defined IPC handlers
3. **LLM Service** - Access through the LLM integration layer

## Security Considerations

- All input is sanitized via `src/shared/utils/sanitization.ts`
- Context data is encrypted in cache
- Engine results are validated before merging
