# Process Pool Management

## Pool Configuration
```typescript
const pool = new ProcessPool({
  minWorkers: 2,
  maxWorkers: 8,
  workerFile: './worker.js',
  resourceLimits: {
    memory: 512, // MB
    cpu: 0.5 // 50% of core
  }
});
```

## Worker Management
Lifecycle methods:
- `acquire()` - Get available worker
- `release(worker)` - Return worker to pool
- `scale(amount)` - Adjust pool size

Example usage:
```typescript
const worker = await pool.acquire();
try {
  const result = await worker.process(task);
} finally {
  pool.release(worker);
}
```

## Resource Monitoring
Key metrics tracked:
- Memory usage per worker
- CPU utilization
- Queue wait times
- Error rates
