# Monitoring Hooks Guide

## Available Hooks
The system provides these integration points:
1. **Pre-analysis** - Before processing begins
2. **Post-analysis** - After results are ready
3. **Error handling** - When exceptions occur
4. **Resource events** - Memory/CPU thresholds

## Custom Hook Creation
To create a new hook:
1. Implement the Hook interface:
```typescript
interface Hook {
  onEvent(data: MetricData): Promise<void>;
}
```
2. Register in `src/monitoring/integration/hooks/registry.ts`

## Best Practices
- Keep hooks stateless when possible
- Handle errors gracefully
- Use appropriate event types
- Document hook purpose clearly

## Performance Considerations
- Avoid long-running operations in hooks
- Use async processing where needed
- Monitor hook execution time
- Consider batching for high-volume events

See [`src/monitoring/integration/hooks/*.ts`](src/monitoring/integration/hooks/) for examples.
