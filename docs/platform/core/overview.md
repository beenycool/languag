# Platform Core Overview

## Architecture
The platform core provides a unified API layer that abstracts platform-specific implementations while exposing common interfaces. Key components:

- **Platform API**: Common interface for all platform operations
- **Native Implementations**: OS-specific implementations (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Adapter Layer**: Converts platform-specific details to common formats

```typescript
// Example: Platform interface
interface PlatformAPI {
  getOS(): OSInfo;
  getPathSeparator(): string;
  normalizePath(path: string): string;
}
```

## Security Considerations
- All platform operations validate permissions
- Sensitive operations require explicit user consent
- File system operations are sandboxed where possible
