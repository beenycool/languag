# Phase 2 Lessons Learned

## Technical Challenges
1. **Clipboard Monitoring**:
   - System-level hooks required careful memory management
   - Solution: Implemented resource manager ([`src/integration/clipboard/service/lifecycle/resource-manager.ts`](src/integration/clipboard/service/lifecycle/resource-manager.ts))

2. **Format Detection**:
   - Edge cases in PDF/RTF detection
   - Solution: Enhanced format analyzer ([`src/integration/clipboard/processing/analyzers/format-analyzer.ts`](src/integration/clipboard/processing/analyzers/format-analyzer.ts))

## Architecture Insights
- Event-driven architecture proved effective for clipboard integration
- Need for stronger isolation between format handlers
- IPC communication patterns established ([`src/integration/communication/protocols/message-protocol.ts`](src/integration/communication/protocols/message-protocol.ts))

## Integration Learnings
- Shell integration required careful permission handling
- Editor state synchronization needed optimization
- Clipboard â†” Editor communication latency identified

## Performance Findings
- Memory usage spikes during format conversion
- Worker pool effective for parallel processing ([`src/renderer/workers/worker-pool.ts`](src/renderer/workers/worker-pool.ts))
- Need for better chunking in large document processing

## Security Discoveries
- Content sanitization critical for LLM integration ([`src/shared/utils/llm-security.ts`](src/shared/utils/llm-security.ts))
- Clipboard data validation essential
- IPC channels need strict validation
