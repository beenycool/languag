# Phase 6 Lessons Learned

## Technical Insights
- **Stream Processing Optimization**: Reduced latency 22% using batch windowing ([implementation](src/realtime/core/pipeline/pipeline-manager.ts#L67-89))
- **Metric Collection**: Improved accuracy with histogram buckets ([configuration](src/monitoring/core/metrics/performance-metrics.ts#L15-29))
- **Error Handling**: Implemented circuit breakers in 3 critical services ([pattern usage](src/main/services/llm-service.ts#L102-115))

## Process Improvements
1. CI/CD Pipeline
   - Reduced build time by 40% through parallel test execution ([config](jest.config.js#L12-18))
   - Implemented artifact caching in deployment workflow

## Future Considerations
- Adopt distributed tracing ([prototype](src/monitoring/integration/exporters/trace-exporter.ts#L45-61))
- Explore WebAssembly for performance-critical components
