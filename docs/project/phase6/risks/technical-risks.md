# Phase 6 Technical Risks

## Implementation Challenges
1. **Predictive Scaling**:
   - Risk: Algorithm accuracy (Medium probability)
   - Mitigation: Implement fallback to rule-based scaling
2. **WASM Integration**:
   - Risk: Performance overhead (Low probability)
   - Mitigation: Benchmark and optimize critical paths

## Performance Concerns
| Risk Area | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|------------|
| API Gateway Load | High | Medium | Auto-scaling + caching |
| Edge Latency | Medium | High | Regional replication |
| Data Consistency | High | Low | Strong consistency mode |

## Security Considerations
- **Zero-Trust Implementation**:
  - Risk: Increased authentication latency
  - Mitigation: Optimize token validation
- **Quantum Encryption**:
  - Risk: Compatibility issues
  - Mitigation: Hybrid encryption approach

## Mitigation Strategies
1. Conduct phased rollouts
2. Implement comprehensive monitoring
3. Maintain rollback capabilities
4. Schedule risk review every 2 weeks
