# AI/ML Integration Analysis

## Model Performance
| Model           | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|-----------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Object Detection | 92.3%    | 89.1%     | 91.4%  | 90.2%    |
| Predictive Maint | 87.5%    | 85.2%     | 88.9%  | 87.0%    |

## Training Results
- 15% reduction in false positives vs Phase 6
- 22% improvement in inference speed
- Reduced model size by 35% through quantization

## Improvement Areas
1. Edge deployment latency (current: 2.1s, target: <1.5s)
2. Model version rollback capabilities
3. Real-time feedback integration
