// Tests for Batch Processor
// Includes tests for:
// - Processing large datasets in batches
// - Batch scheduling and execution
// - Handling of partial failures within a batch
// - Data partitioning and parallel processing of batches
// - Job monitoring and reporting for batch processes
// - Performance and resource management for batch jobs
//
// Mocks:
// - Large datasets (or generators for them)
// - Distributed file systems (e.g., HDFS, S3 mocks)
// - Batch job schedulers
// - Resource managers (e.g., YARN mock)
