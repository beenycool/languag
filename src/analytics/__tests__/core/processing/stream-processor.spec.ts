// Tests for Stream Processor
// Includes tests for:
// - Real-time data ingestion and processing
// - Windowing operations (tumbling, sliding, session)
// - Watermarking and handling late data
// - State management for stream operations
// - Fault tolerance and recovery in streaming
// - Performance under high-velocity streams
//
// Mocks:
// - Stream sources (e.g., Kafka, Kinesis, mock event emitters)
// - State stores
// - Windowing functions
