// Tests for Report Exporter
// Focuses on exporting fully generated reports (text, charts, tables)
// Includes tests for:
// - Exporting reports to PDF, HTML, DOCX
// - Handling reports with multiple pages and complex layouts
// - Ensuring all embedded content (charts, images) is correctly included
// - Maintaining report formatting and styling during export
// - Error handling specific to report export processes
//
// Mocks:
// - ReportGenerator output (e.g., an in-memory representation of a report)
// - Libraries for PDF, HTML, DOCX generation/conversion (e.g., Puppeteer, pdfmake, mammoth.js)
// - File system operations
