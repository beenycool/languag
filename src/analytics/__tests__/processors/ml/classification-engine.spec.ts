// Tests for Classification Engine
// Focuses on supervised learning for classification tasks
// Includes tests for:
// - Model training with various classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks)
// - Feature engineering and selection for classification
// - Model evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC AUC)
// - Making class predictions and probability estimates on new data
// - Handling of binary and multi-class classification
// - Dealing with imbalanced datasets
//
// Mocks:
// - Datasets for classification tasks (binary and multi-class)
// - Pre-trained model artifacts
// - ML libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch - for integration)
