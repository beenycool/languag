// Tests for Data Collector
// Includes tests for:
// - Orchestrating data collection from multiple sources via connectors
// - Data aggregation and normalization from different sources
// - Scheduling and triggering of collection tasks
// - Error handling during collection from various sources
// - Data validation and quality checks post-collection
// - Performance of the collection process
//
// Mocks:
// - Various connectors (Database, Stream, API)
// - Schedulers
// - Data validation services
