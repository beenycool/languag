// Tests for Event Collector
// Focuses on collecting event-specific data (e.g., user interactions, system logs)
// Includes tests for:
// - Collecting events from various event streams or logs
// - Event parsing and enrichment
// - Real-time event ingestion
// - Filtering and routing of events
// - Handling high volume and velocity of events
// - Error handling for event collection
//
// Mocks:
// - Event stream sources (e.g., mock message queues, log file readers)
// - Event parsing libraries
// - Enrichment services (e.g., geo-IP lookup, user profile service)
