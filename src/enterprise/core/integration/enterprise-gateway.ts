/**
 * @file Enterprise API Gateway
 *
 * This file defines the core API gateway for enterprise integrations.
 * It handles incoming requests, routes them to appropriate services,
 * and manages cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and rate limiting.
 *
 * Focus areas:
 * - Enterprise security: Implements robust authentication and authorization.
 * - Scalability: Designed for horizontal scaling to handle high request volumes.
 * - Reliability: Includes mechanisms for fault tolerance and request retries.
 * - Compliance: Ensures logging and auditing for compliance requirements.
 * - Performance monitoring: Integrates with monitoring tools to track API performance.
 * - Error handling: Provides standardized error responses and handling.
