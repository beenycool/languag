  // TODO: Add tests for normal recovery operations (e.g., restarting a service, reverting to a safe state)
  // TODO: Add tests for recovery edge cases (e.g., repeated failures requiring different recovery strategies)
  // TODO: Add tests for recovery error conditions (e.g., recovery process itself fails, unable to reach a stable state)
  // TODO: Add tests for recovery performance characteristics (e.g., time to recover, impact on users during recovery)
  // TODO: Add tests for recovery security measures (e.g., ensuring recovery doesn't open vulnerabilities)
  // TODO: Add tests for recovery resource management (e.g., cleaning up resources after a failed recovery attempt)

  // TODO: Add mocks for:
  // - System resources (e.g., service control managers, process managers)
  // - External services (e.g., to notify about recovery actions)
  // - Application state (to verify state restoration)
