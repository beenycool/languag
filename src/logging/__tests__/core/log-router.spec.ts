  // TODO: Add tests for normal log routing operations (e.g., routing based on log level, source, content)
  // TODO: Add tests for log routing edge cases (e.g., complex routing rules, multiple matching rules)
  // TODO: Add tests for log routing error conditions (e.g., no matching route, misconfigured routing rules)
  // TODO: Add tests for log routing performance characteristics (e.g., routing decision time)
  // TODO: Add tests for log routing security measures (e.g., ensuring logs are not misrouted to unauthorized handlers)
  // TODO: Add tests for log routing resource management (e.g., efficient rule evaluation)

  // TODO: Add mocks for:
  // - Log handlers (to verify logs are routed correctly)
