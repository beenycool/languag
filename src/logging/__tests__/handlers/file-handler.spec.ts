  // TODO: Add tests for normal file logging operations (e.g., writing logs to a file, log rotation)
  // TODO: Add tests for file logging edge cases (e.g., full disk, file permissions issues, concurrent writes)
  // TODO: Add tests for file logging error conditions (e.g., invalid file path, unable to open file for writing)
  // TODO: Add tests for file logging performance characteristics (e.g., write speed, impact of rotation)
  // TODO: Add tests for file logging security measures (e.g., ensuring log files have correct permissions)
  // TODO: Add tests for file logging resource management (e.g., managing file handles, disk space)

  // TODO: Add mocks for:
  // - File system operations (e.g., `fs.open`, `fs.write`, `fs.rename` for rotation)
  // - Time-based operations (e.g., for scheduled log rotation)
