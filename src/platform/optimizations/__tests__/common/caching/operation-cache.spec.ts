  // TODO: Implement tests for a generic operation/computation cache
  // - Performance improvements measurement (e.g., reduced execution time for cached operations)
  // - Cache effectiveness (hit/miss rates, correct return of cached results)
  // - Proper cache key generation and collision handling (if applicable)
  // - Cache eviction policies (e.g., LRU, LFU, TTL) and their correctness
  // - Error handling (e.g., issues during cache storage/retrieval, serialization errors if applicable)
  // - Edge cases (e.g., caching operations with side effects - generally not advised, large result sets)
  // - Concurrency: ensure thread-safety if the cache is accessed from multiple threads/async operations

  // Mock the operations being cached (e.g., expensive computations, I/O-bound tasks)
  // Mock time-sensitive operations for TTL testing
