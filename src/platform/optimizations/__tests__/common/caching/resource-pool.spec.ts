  // TODO: Implement tests for a generic resource pool (e.g., connections, worker threads)
  // - Performance improvements measurement (e.g., reduced latency for acquiring resources)
  // - Correct acquisition and release of resources from/to the pool
  // - Pool sizing behavior (min/max limits, dynamic resizing if applicable)
  // - Handling of resource exhaustion (e.g., blocking, timeouts, errors when pool is empty)
  // - Resource validation/health checks before lending and after returning (if applicable)
  // - Error handling (e.g., issues creating new resources, invalid resources returned)
  // - Edge cases (e.g., high contention for resources, rapid acquire/release cycles)
  // - Concurrency: ensure thread-safety of pool operations

  // Mock the resources being pooled (e.g., database connections, network sockets, worker objects)
  // Mock time-sensitive operations for timeout testing
