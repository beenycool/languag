  // - Processing of batches based on triggers (e.g., size, time interval)
  // - Performance: efficiency of batch creation and processing
  // - Error handling for entire batches or individual items within a batch
  // - Order preservation if required for items within a batch or across batches
  // - Resource management (e.g., handling large batches, memory usage)
  // - Edge cases (e.g., empty batches, very frequent item submission, flush on shutdown)
  // - Concurrency: safe submission of items from multiple sources

  // Mock the items to be batched and the operation performed on each batch
  // Mock time (e.g., Jest's fake timers) for time-based batching triggers
