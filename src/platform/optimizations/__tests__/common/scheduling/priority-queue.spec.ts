  // TODO: Implement tests for a generic priority queue
  // - Correct ordering of items based on priority
  // - Efficient enqueue and dequeue operations
  // - Performance: behavior with large numbers of items and varying priorities
  // - Handling of items with the same priority (e.g., FIFO, LIFO)
  // - Dynamic priority changes (if supported)
  // - Error handling (e.g., queue full if bounded, invalid priority values)
  // - Edge cases (e.g., empty queue, queue with all same-priority items)
  // - Concurrency: thread-safe enqueue and dequeue operations

  // Mock the items being added to the queue, including their priorities
