  // TODO: Implement tests for a generic task scheduler
  // - Correct execution of scheduled tasks (one-time, recurring, delayed)
  // - Adherence to scheduling parameters (timing, frequency, priority if applicable)
  // - Performance: low overhead for scheduling and execution
  // - Error handling for tasks that throw exceptions
  // - Cancellation of pending tasks
  // - Resource management (e.g., thread pool usage for task execution)
  // - Edge cases (e.g., scheduling many tasks, tasks with very short/long durations, system time changes)
  // - Concurrency: safe scheduling and cancellation from multiple threads

  // Mock the tasks being scheduled (functions or objects with an execute method)
  // Mock time (e.g., using Jest's fake timers) to control task execution timing
