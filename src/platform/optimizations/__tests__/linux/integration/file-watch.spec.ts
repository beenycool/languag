  // TODO: Implement tests for file watching (inotify, fanotify) optimizations
  // - Performance improvements measurement (e.g., responsiveness to file system events, low overhead)
  // - Correct and timely detection of file/directory changes (create, delete, modify, move)
  // - Efficient use of inotify/fanotify resources (e.g., watch descriptors, event queue management)
  // - Error handling and recovery (e.g., reaching watch limits, permission issues)
  // - Edge cases (e.g., watching large directory trees, symbolic links, network file systems)
  // - Resource usage (CPU, memory) of the file watching mechanism

  // Mock OS-specific APIs for inotify (inotify_init, inotify_add_watch, read) or fanotify
  // Mock file system operations to trigger events
