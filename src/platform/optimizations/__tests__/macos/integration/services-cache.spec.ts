  // - Performance improvements measurement (e.g., faster responses from services due to caching)
  // - Cache effectiveness (hit/miss rates, data consistency with underlying services)
  // - Error handling and recovery (e.g., service unavailability, cache corruption)
  // - Edge cases (e.g., frequently updated service data, large data sets from services)
  // - Correct invalidation of cache when service data changes

  // Mock OS-specific APIs for interacting with macOS services (e.g., CoreSpotlight, QuickLookThumbnailing)
  // Mock data responses from these services
